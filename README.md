Maintaining software can be challenging especially in light of the fact that everyday new vulnerabilities are found throughout the software world. The problem becomes even more complex when a software engineer has the incredible task of patching a vulnerability. The patch that is developed needs to solve the problem while not impacting the functionality of the software product. Additionally, these software patches need to be carefully considered such that the patch does not cause more vulnerabilities as well as the patch needs to ensure that the vulnerability is solved, this meaning that the vulnerability will not come back if a software update is pushed. The API presented aims to bring together software engineering and cybersecurity to evaluate software engineering approaches to patching legacy web application vulnerabilities.
